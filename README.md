# twitter_bot
Create a Twitter Bot that retweets and like any post or comment I get tagged in. Deployed it then on the cloud using Heroku service.

Make sure to use a python version <3.7 to be able to use Tweepy, I used python-version==3.6.13'.
If you have any version problem while deploying in on Heroku, check the supported Python version by Heruko.
